altitude	geographical altitude of the location from which the sample was collected
bio_material	identifier for the biological material from which the nucleic acid sequenced was obtained, with optional institution code and collection code for the place where it is currently stored.
cell_line	cell line from which the sequence was obtained
cell_type	cell type from which the sequence was obtained
chromosome	chromosome (e.g. Chromosome number) from which the sequence was obtained
citation	reference to a citation listed in the entry reference field
clone	clone from which the sequence was obtained
clone_lib	clone library from which the sequence was obtained
collection_date	date that the specimen was collected
country	locality of isolation of the sequenced organism indicated in terms of political names for nations, oceans or seas, followed by regions and localities
cultivar	cultivar (cultivated variety) of plant from which sequence was  obtained.
culture_collection	institution code and identifier for the culture from which the nucleic acid sequenced was obtained, with optional collection code.
db_xref	database cross-reference: pointer to related information in  another database.
dev_stage	if the sequence was obtained from an organism in a specific  developmental stage, it is specified with this qualifier
haplogroup	name for a group of similar haplotypes that share some sequence variation. Haplogroups are often used to track migration of population groups.
haplotype	name for a combination of alleles that are linked together on the same physical chromosome. In the absence of recombination, each haplotype is inherited as a unit, and may be used to track gene flow in populations.
host	natural (as opposed to laboratory) host to the organism from which sequenced molecule was obtained
isolate	individual isolate from which the sequence was obtained
isolation_source	describes the physical, environmental and/or local geographical source of the biological sample from which the sequence was derived
lab_host	scientific name of the laboratory host used to propagate the source organism from which the sequenced molecule was obtained
map	genomic map position of feature
mating_type	mating type of the organism from which the sequence was obtained; mating type is used for prokaryotes, and for eukaryotes that undergo meiosis without sexually dimorphic gametes
note	any comment or additional information
PCR_primers	PCR primers that were used to amplify the sequence. A single /PCR_primers qualifier should contain all the primers used for a single PCR reaction. If multiple forward or reverse primers are present in a  single PCR reaction, multiple sets of fwd_name/fwd_seq or rev_name/rev_seq values will be  present.
plasmid	name of naturally occurring plasmid from which the sequence was  obtained, where plasmid is defined as an independently replicating genetic unit that cannot be described by /chromosome or /segment
pop_variant	name of subpopulation or phenotype of the sample from which the sequence was derived
segment	name of viral or phage segment sequenced
serotype	serological variety of a species characterized by its antigenic properties
serovar	serological variety of a species (usually a prokaryote) characterized by its antigenic properties
sex	sex of the organism from which the sequence was obtained; sex is used for eukaryotic organisms that undergo meiosis and have sexually dimorphic gametes
specimen_voucher	identifier for the specimen from which the nucleic acid sequenced was obtained
strain	strain from which sequence was obtained
sub_clone	sub-clone from which sequence was obtained
sub_species	name of sub-species of organism from which sequence was obtained
sub_strain	name or identifier of a genetically or otherwise modified  strain from which sequence was obtained, derived from a parental strain (which should be annotated in the /strain qualifier).sub_strain from which sequence was obtained
tissue_lib	tissue library from which sequence was obtained
tissue_type	tissue type from which the sequence was obtained
variety	variety (= varietas, a formal Linnaean rank) of organism  from which sequence was derived.
