The source code for third-party files we distribute under the LGPL 2.1 license can be
downloaded from the same site we make Geneious available for download.

The source code for third party files we distribute under LGPL 3.0 can be downloaded
from the respective third-party software project sites.

piccolo_xml.jar is based on Piccolo 1.0.4 (from http://piccolo.sourceforge.net/) but we have made some bug fixes to it.

smack.jar is based on smack 2.2.0 by Jive Software, but it is not the
original release. We have made some changes (bugfixes) to the Smack
sourcecode and built smack.jar ourselves.

Modifications made to Glazed Lists files are available in
bundledPlugins/com.biomatters.plugins.annotationTableViewer.AnnotationTableViewerPlugin.jar
in the file "glazedListsModifications.txt".
The original Glazed Lists source code can be downloaded from http://www.glazedlists.com/
