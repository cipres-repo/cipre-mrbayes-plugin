License Grant:

The Software is the property of Biomatters. The Software is licensed for use under this Agreement, not sold. Biomatters retains ownership of the Software itself and reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.
					
The terms of this Agreement will govern any updates to the Software provided by Biomatters, unless such update is accompanied by a separate Entitlement, in which case the terms of the corresponding license agreement will govern.
					
The Licensor grants to the Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable License to use the Software in the manner described in this Agreement. This License does not constitute the sale of the original Software or any copy thereof.
					
Upon purchase of an Entitlement, the Licensee will receive a unique key-code (hereinafter referred to as a "License Key") that enables an Authorized User to use the Entitled Software according to the terms and conditions of the specific Entitlement type as described below. Only the Licensor is permitted to produce License Keys for the Software.
					
Personal Entitlement: Upon purchase of a Personal Entitlement, the Licensee may install and use the Entitled Software on up to three (3) computers running any of the supported operating systems, provided that the same License Key is not used by anyone other than the Authorized User.
					
Floating Entitlement: Purchase of a Floating Entitlement permits the Licensee to install and use the Entitled Software on an unlimited number of computers running any of the supported operating systems on the same network, and for Authorized Users to use the Entitled Software on different computers on that network concurrently, provided that the number of Authorized Users using the Entitled Software on different computers concurrently will be limited to the number of Floating Entitlements registered to the Licensee and currently active.

Purchase of a Release Entitlement entitles the Licensee to a specified release of the Software (e.g. R7) and subsequent updates to the specified release of the Software (e.g., R7.1), but does not entitle Licensee to subsequent, unspecified releases of the Software (e.g., R8). Purchase of a Release Entitlement allows the Licensee to use the specified release of the Software for a period of unlimited duration.
					
A Time-limited Entitlement allows the Licensee to use any currently supported release of the Software during the time period specified. Time-limited Entitlements are valid from the date of issue until the specified date of expiration. At the end of the validity period, the Entitlement granted under this Agreement shall terminate, and the Software will revert to Restricted Software until a new Entitlement is provisioned.
					
Biomatters provides free e-mail and phone based technical support to Authorized Users holding an active Entitlement for the most recent update to the current release of the Software and the most recent update to the previous release of the Software.

LICENSOR DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE OR ANY EQUIPMENT, SYSTEM OR NETWORK ON WHICH THE SOFTWARE IS USED WILL BE FREE OF VULNERABILITY TO INTRUSION OR ATTACK. THE FOREGOING EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
