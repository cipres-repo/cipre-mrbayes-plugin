<h2>Geneious Plugin Development Kit - Readme</h2>
<p>
    The Geneious Public <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/API">API</a> consists of a set of classes and
    interfaces which allow you to write plugins for Geneious.  The API is very powerful and
    so useful that many parts of the standard Geneious application, such as the sequence
    viewer and local database service, are implemented through it.  For a full list of the plugins
    that come with Geneious click the "Tools" menu, select "Plugins", then "Customize Feature Set".
</p>
<p>
    Geneious is written in version 6 of the <a href="http://java.sun.com/">Java</a> programming language.
    If you want to write plugins for Geneious you will need some knowledge of Java,
    and the Java Development Kit (JDK) which can be downloaded
    from Sun <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">here</a> if you're using Windows,
    from Apple <a href="http://developer.apple.com/java/">here</a> if you're using Mac OS X
    or via your package manager or the Sun Java website if you're using Linux.
