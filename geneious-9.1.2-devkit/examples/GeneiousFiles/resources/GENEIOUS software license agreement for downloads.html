<h3>License Grant:</h3>

<p>The Software is the property of Biomatters. The Software is licensed for use under this Agreement, not sold. Biomatters retains ownership of the Software itself and reserves all rights not expressly granted to you.</p>

<p>The terms of this Agreement will govern any updates to the Software provided by Biomatters, unless such update is accompanied by a separate Entitlement, in which case the terms of the corresponding license agreement will govern.</p>

<p>The Licensor grants to the Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable License to use the Software in the manner described in this Agreement. This License does not constitute the sale of the original Software or any copy thereof.</p>

<p>Upon purchase of an Entitlement, the Licensee will receive a unique key-code (hereinafter referred to as a &quot;License Key&quot;) that enables an Authorized User to use the Entitled Software according to the terms and conditions of the specific Entitlement type as described below. Only the Licensor is permitted to produce License Keys for the Software.</p>

<p>Personal Entitlement: Upon purchase of a Personal Entitlement, the Licensee may install and use the Entitled Software on up to three (3) computers running any of the supported operating systems, provided that the same License Key is not used by anyone other than the Authorized User.</p>

<p>Floating Entitlement: Purchase of a Floating Entitlement permits the Licensee to install and use the Entitled Software on an unlimited number of computers running any of the supported operating systems on the same network, and for Authorized Users to use the Entitled Software on different computers on that network concurrently, provided that the number of Authorized Users using the Entitled Software on different computers concurrently will be limited to the number of Floating Entitlements registered to the Licensee and currently active.</p>

<p>Non-commercial Entitlement: A Non-commercial Entitlement allows the Licensee to use the Entitled Software for non-commercial purposes only.</p>

<p>Commercial Entitlement: A Commercial Entitlement allows the Licensee to use the Entitled Software for non-commercial and commercial purposes.</p>

<p>Student Entitlement: A Student Entitlement may be used by undergraduate and graduate students currently enrolled in a degree program, and allows the Licensee to use the Entitled Software for non-commercial purposes only.</p>

<h3>Software Entitlement Duration, Updates, and Support:</h3>

<p>Purchase of a Release Entitlement entitles the Licensee to a specified release of the Software (e.g. R7) and subsequent updates to the specified release of the Software (e.g., R7.1), but does not entitle Licensee to subsequent, unspecified releases of the Software (e.g., R8). Purchase of a Release Entitlement allows the Licensee to use the specified release of the Software for a period of unlimited duration.</p>

<p>A Time-limited Entitlement allows the Licensee to use any currently supported release of the Software during the time period specified. Time-limited Entitlements are valid from the date of issue until the specified date of expiration. At the end of the validity period, the Entitlement granted under this Agreement shall terminate, and the Software will revert to Restricted Software until a new Entitlement is provisioned.</p>

<p>Biomatters provides free e-mail and phone based technical support to Authorized Users holding an active Entitlement for the most recent update to the current release of the Software and the most recent update to the previous release of the Software.</p>

<h3>Use of Restricted Software:</h3>

<p>The Software may be used in restricted mode without an active purchased Entitlement, though functionality of the Restricted Software is limited with no guarantee of availability of or continued availability of individual features.</p>

<p>Termination: This Agreement will terminate automatically if Licensee fails to comply with the limitations described herein. In the event of termination by reason of the Licensee&#39;s failure to comply with any part of this agreement, or upon any act which shall give rise to Licensor&#39;s right to terminate, Licensor shall have the right, at any time, to terminate the license(s) and take immediate possession or confirm destruction of the Software and documentation and all copies wherever located, without demand or notice. Within five (5) days after termination of the license(s), Licensee will return to Licensor the Software in the form provided by Licensor or as modified by the Licensee, or upon request by Licensor destroy the Software and all copies, and certify in writing that they have been destroyed. Without limiting any of the above provisions, in the event of termination as a result of the Licensee&#39;s failure to comply with any of its obligations under this License Agreement, the Licensee shall continue to be obligated for any payments due. Termination of the License shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any equitable remedies available to Licensor.</p>

<p>Injunction: In the event Biomatters reasonably believes that the use or distribution of any Geneious software, Geneious materials or Biomatters Trademarks is likely to be enjoined, Biomatters may, among other things, take back such infringing item or items and terminate the license associated with respect to such item or items. Biomatters may also seek judicial intervention including, without limitation, an injunction in the Courts of New Zealand and/or the State Courts of New Jersey in the United States of America, to which injunctive relief the Licensee expressly consents hereby and agrees not to oppose.</p>

<p>Limited Reciprocal Indemnification: Each party shall, at its own expense, defend and indemnify the other party for damages and reasonable costs incurred in any suit, claim or proceeding brought by a third party against the indemnified party alleging any claims against the indemnified party for damages resulting solely and directly from a breach of contract or tort committed by the indemnifying party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the maximum liability of the indemnifying party under this clause shall be the dollar amount of fees paid to purchase Entitlements to the most recent release of the Software.</p>

IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT LICENSOR RECEIVED FROM LICENSEE FOR A LICENSE OF THE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR FOR ANY CLAIM BY ANY THIRD PARTY. LICENSOR DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE OR ANY EQUIPMENT, SYSTEM OR NETWORK ON WHICH THE SOFTWARE IS USED WILL BE FREE OF VULNERABILITY TO INTRUSION OR ATTACK. THE FOREGOING EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.</p>
