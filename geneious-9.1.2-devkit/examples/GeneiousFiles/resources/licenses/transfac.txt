 *** TRANSFAC Release 3.2 (Export from 23.06.1997, 10.00 MEZ) ***

------------------------------------------------------------------

            T e c h n i c a l   I n f o r m a t i o n s 

There are 6 TRANSFAC data files: 

     site.dat
     factor.dat
     cell.dat
     class.dat
     matrix.dat
     gene.dat

The data files are  ASCII files,  all of them being written on IBM-PC
compatible systems. 

The compressed file  (transfac32.tar.Z)  has been generated using the
Unix command "compress" - to decompress use "uncompress".
The files have been converted with DOS2UNIX. 

The compressed  file  (transfac32.zip)  has  been generated using the
the DOS  ZIP-Programm  ftp://transfac.gbf.de/pub/transfac/pkzip.exe -
to decompress use "pkunzip.exe -x [Filename]".

If you use DOS version ftp://transfac.gbf.de/pub/transfac/pkunzip.exe 
you have to rename the ZIP-file to the 8 + 3 limitation of DOS (e. g.
"transfac.zip"). WinZip can extract the long filenames.
