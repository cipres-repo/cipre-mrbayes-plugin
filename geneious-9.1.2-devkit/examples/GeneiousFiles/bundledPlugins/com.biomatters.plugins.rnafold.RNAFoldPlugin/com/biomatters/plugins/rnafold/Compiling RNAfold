Build RNAfold for Linux on a 32-bit CentOS 5 system using ./configure LDFLAGS="-static"
to get a 32 bit static linked executable compatible with newer and 64 bit systems
Windows needs ./configure --disable-openmp
setting to compile with minGW otherwise the resulting binaries won't run on a standard
Windows install.
Mac can be simple ./configure if it is built on a 32-bit machine running the oldest MacOS
we currently support.
On all platforms, then run make to produce the executables in the Progs directory.
