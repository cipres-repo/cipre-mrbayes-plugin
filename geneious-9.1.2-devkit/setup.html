<h2>Geneious Plugin Development Kit - Setup</h2>
<p>
    Geneious plugins can be developed in whatever Java development environment you are comfortable using.
    Note that <em>Geneious still supports Java 6</em>, so for maximum compatibility you should avoid using APIs or
    language features from Java 7 or later.
    The included Eclipse, IntelliJ and Ant examples should already be set up to use Java 6.<br>
    <br>
    Once you have downloaded and installed the Java Development Kit (JDK) for your platform follow the instructions below for
    setting up Geneious plugin development in <a href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> or <a href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ IDEA</a>.
    There is also an explanation of what is required to run Geneious if you want to set everything up yourself,
    and a brief discussion of building and distributing your plugins once you have something you want to share with the world!<br>
    <br>
    Also be aware that this version of Geneious does not bundle licence activation code for size reasons,
    so if you want to activate a Geneious licence you will need to <a href="http://desktop-links.geneious.com/download">download</a>
    the standard Geneious release for your platform.
</p>
<h3>Eclipse</h3>
<p>
    These instructions are for version 3.6 of Eclipse (Helios); the exact steps may differ in other versions.<br>
    <br>
    Open Eclipse. From the <b>File</b> menu, select <b>Import...</b><br>
    Expand the <b>General</b> folder and select <b>Existing Projects into Workspace</b>.<br>
    Click the <b>Next</b> button, then click the <b>Browse...</b> button next to the "Select root directory:" field.<br>
    Navigate to the "examples" directory (which should be in the same place as this document) and select it.<br>
    Click <b>OK</b> and a dozen or so projects should appear in the Projects textfield.<br> 
    Click <b>Finish</b> and they should appear in the Package Explorer navigation pane in Eclipse.<br>
    You may need to close the Eclipse welcome screen to get to the workbench and see the newly imported projects.<br>
    Select the <b>Run</b> menu and click <b>Debug Configurations</b>. <br>
    Under "Java Applications" select one of the preconfigured applications, we suggest "ExampleDocumentViewer" to get started.<br>
    Select one with "32 bit" or "64 bit" in the name to match the bit size of your Java VM.<br>
    Click <b>Debug</b> to launch Geneious with this sample plugin enabled.<br>
    When you select a sequence you should see the "Ludicrously Giant Sequence Viewer" as an option in the lower panel in Geneious.<br>
    If you set a breakpoint within the code (by right clicking in the margin and selecting <b>Toggle Breakpoint</b>) execution should stop at that line so you can debug.<br>
    (To view the source code for the examples expand them in the Package Explorer in Eclipse)<br>
    A good place to test this is in the "paintComponent" method of the "ExampleDocumentViewer.java" file.<br>
    Switching back to Geneious and selecting the "Ludicrously Giant Sequence Viewer" should trigger the breakpoint.<br>
    <ul><li>
    If you are using 32 bit Windows (or a 32 bit Java VM on 64 bit Windows) and a Geneious FLEXnet licence to get Pro features you will need to copy the contents of the "examples\GeneiousFiles\native_libs\win32" directory to the "examples\GeneiousFiles" directory. The 4 pre-existing files in the GeneiousFiles directory are 64 bit.
    </li></ul>
</p>
<h3>IntelliJ IDEA</h3>
<p>
    These instructions are for version 13 of IntelliJ IDEA; the exact steps may differ in other versions.<br>
    <br>
    Open IntelliJ IDEA. From the <b>File</b> menu, select <b>Open...</b><br>
    Navigate to the "examples" directory (which should be in the same place as this document), select it and click <b>OK</b>.<br>
    The "ExampleDocumentViewerPlugin.java" file should now be open in the editor. If there are errors (eg some text is red) you may need to set up your JDK.<br>
    To set up your JDK click <b>File</b>, then <b>Project Structure</b>, then either select a preconfigured SDK or create a new one (must be Java 6).<br>
    To create a new SDK click <b>New</b>, then <b>JSDK</b> and select the location where the Java Development Kit is installed (you may need to use a <a href="http://google.com/search?q=java+jdk+installation+directory">search engine</a> if you don't know where this is on your operating system).<br>
    Click OK and the JDK should appear in the combobox to the left. Click <b>OK</b> again and you should be returned to the editor.<br>
    You may see a warning similar to "Class ISeekMain not found in module". This can be ignored as the class is provided at runtime.<br>
    You should now be able to click <b>Run</b> in the menu then <b>Debug</b> to start Geneious with the "ExampleDocumentViewer" Debug Configuration.<br>
    Select a debug configuration with "32 bit" or "64 bit" in the name to match the bit size of your Java VM.<br>
    Note you may need to wait for IntelliJ to index the project before this option becomes available.<br>
    When you select a sequence you should see the "Ludicrously Giant Sequence Viewer" as an option in the lower panel in Geneious.<br>
    If you set a breakpoint within the code (by clicking in the margin) execution should stop at that line so you can debug.<br>
    A good place to test this is in the "paintComponent" method of the "ExampleDocumentViewer.java" file.<br>
    Switching back to Geneious and selecting the "Ludicrously Giant Sequence Viewer" should trigger the breakpoint.<br>
    <ul><li>
    If you are using 32 bit Windows (or a 32 bit Java VM on 64 bit Windows) and a Geneious FLEXnet licence to get Pro features you will need to copy the contents of the "examples\GeneiousFiles\native_libs\win32" directory to the "examples\GeneiousFiles" directory. The 4 pre-existing files in the GeneiousFiles directory are 64 bit.
    </li></ul>
</p>
<h3>Setting it up yourself</h3>
<p>
    This description is fairly generic and should allow you to set up a debugging environment yourself.<br>
    <br>
    All the files required to run Geneious are in the "GeneiousFiles" directory. This should be set as the Java VM working directory.<br>
    The main class (in the java sense of the word) is com.biomatters.iseek.application.ISeekMain which is in the ISeek.jar file.<br>
    We use the following VM arguments with the examples: "-ea -Xss512K -Xms256M -Xmx768M -XX:MaxPermSize=96M", we also use "-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC" to increase performance on 64 bit VMs.<br>
    You may need to tweak the memory settings (Xmx and MaxPermSize) depending on your machine specs and what you're trying to do with Geneious.<br>
    The jars in the lib directory will need to be on the java classpath, as will the resources directory.<br>
    You may code against GeniousPublicAPI.jar, jebl.jar and jdom.jar.<br>
    Geneious will automatically pick up its plugins from the bundledPlugins directory.<br>
    There are several ways to get Geneious to load an external plugin:<br>
    <ul>
    <li>
    Have your class that extends GeneiousPlugin on the classpath and pass its fully qualified name as an argument to Geneious, using the parameter "extraPlugins"<br>
    eg extraPlugins="com.biomatters.exampleDocumentViewerPlugin.ExampleDocumentViewerPlugin"<br>
    This is used in the supplied examples.
    </li>
    <li>
    On startup Geneious also searches several directories and loads any plugins it finds there. There is one that is global for all users and one that is user specific.
    These vary by system, but the user specific one can be found in the "plugins" folder of their user data directory.<br>
    This is where plugins are put when they are dragged'n'dropped into Geneious. If the global location is not writable by the current user
    the plugin is put in their data directory and is available for them only.
    </li>
    </ul>
    In order to use a Geneious FLEXnet licence to get Pro features you will have to do the following:<br>
    <ul>
    <li>
    If you are using 64 bit Windows with a 64 bit Java VM you should be good to go
    </li>
    <li>
    If you are using 32 bit Windows (or a 32 bit Java VM on 64 bit Windows) copy the contents of the "examples\GeneiousFiles\native_libs\win32" directory to the "examples\GeneiousFiles" directory. The 4 pre-existing files in the GeneiousFiles directory are 64 bit.
    </li>
    <li>
    If you are using MacOS add "./activation/macos:./native_libs/macos" to the DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.<br>
    </li>
    <li>
    If you are using Linux add the Linux equivalents of the MacOS example above to the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.<br>
    </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Building and distributing your plugin</h3>
<p>
    The easiest way to make your own plugin is to edit one of the examples and go from there.<br>
    The provided examples all come with Ant build scripts which include a task which will rename everything to a name you choose.<br>
    In both Eclipse and IntelliJ the Ant file may be opened by double clicking on the "build.xml" file.<br>
    Both also have a dedicated tool for running Ant scripts, to make this visible:
    <ul>
    <li>
    in Eclipse select "Window" from the main menu, then "Show View" and "Ant". You may also need to add the build.xml file by dragging it in.
    </li>
    <li>
    in Intellij select "Window" from the main menu, then "Tool Windows" and "Ant Build". You may also need to add the build.xml file using the "+" icon.
    </li>
    </ul>
    The "copyPluginAndRename" task will make a copy of the example, follow the instructions in the XML to give it a new name and package.<br>
    The resulting directory will be in the same place as the examples so it can reference the GeneiousFiles project.<br>
    If you want to move it elsewhere you will need to copy this project too, or set up the references using the description above.<br>
    In Eclipse you should be able to import it into the workspace as you did with the other examples.<br>
    IntelliJ should automatically pick up the new project.<br>
    <br>
    The Ant scripts also include a task that will build a gplugin file, which can then be dragged'n'dropped into Geneious to install the plugin.<br>
    Geneious will recognize plugins distributed in one of two ways:
    <ul>
    <li>
    A jar file with extension .gplugin containing:<br>
    - a plugin.properties file which has at least one property "plugin-name" which must
    be equal to the fully qualified name of your GeneiousPlugin class.<br>
    - the compiled class structure for your plugin
    </li>
    <li>
    A zip file with extension .gplugin containing only a single folder named exactly the same
    as the fully qualified name of your GeneiousPlugin class. This folder must then contain
    your plugin jar file (can have any name) and any other files your plugin uses. This folder
    will be given to your plugin at runtime through the pluginDirectory parameter of the
    initialize method.
    </li>
    </ul>
    If your plugin is installed as a folder and contains a readme.txt or readme.html file then Geneious
    will automatically display the text (or html) in the file to users when the plugin is first installed.
    This is a good place to include a short introduction to the features of your plugin and any papers that
    should be cited when publishing results.
